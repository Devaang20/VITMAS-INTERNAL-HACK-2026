CLANKER — The Freshman Survival Database
CLANKER is an AI-powered campus assistant designed to help new students quickly find essential information about university life — from medical emergencies and hostel rules to WiFi issues, mess timings, and academic procedures.
Built as a prototype for an internal hack at VIT Vellore, the system demonstrates how lightweight Natural Language Processing can deliver fast, offline-friendly student support without requiring large language models or internet connectivity.
